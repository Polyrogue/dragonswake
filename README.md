# dragon's wake

This is an example of the web development, done as a personal project in mid 2017 over the course of a week.

A simple website, it was for use with integration with a public online game run on a chat server, in order to house rules and information.

Serving also as a refresher for web development key skills, this project utilises HTML, CSS, and some basic Javascript functionality, in addition to some utilisation of jQuery.

Whilst the game is over and the original domain for the site has been shut down, the final version is now being hosted on [polyrogue.com](http://polyrogue.com/dw/)
