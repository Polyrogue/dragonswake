          <br></br>
          <div style="text-align: left;">
            <p>For the longest time, the island was thought to be a waste of landmass — a slightly-larger-than-average rock with unusable resources, flooded with dangerous beasts, where no sane person would establish a stronghold. The legend has it that the Dwarves proved them right on all accounts.</p>
            <p>According to scholars, the Dwarves made the northern part of the continent their home. Having established themselves, not necessarily as the master species, but rather one of many, they spread out — on land and under — while performing research and deducting experiments on the life forms they found.</p>
            <p>All meanwhile, the rest of the world went on with their lives. The races warred, made peace, warred again, and all with very little contact to the Isle. At one point between some wars, an Elven noble of High Elf descent got wind of a rumour about the island, it had a secret. Supposedly the key to life itself was hidden somewhere deep inside it. What that meant exactly was never told, but the concept implied great power, and because of the tension between the races at the time, the Elves wanted to ensure that if anybody had control over something so powerful, it would be them.</p>
            <p>Not much is known about what occurred on the island after that. All that is known now is that the island is still considered a barely habitable landmass in a strategically unimportant part of the world. But, because of the rest of the world slowly becoming all but discovered, this is now the final frontier for adventurers seeking fame and glory.</p>
            <p>After The Great Peace, the world flourished and the races all came together. A democratic society, The All-Hood, was established with equal values for all sentient races that wished to be part of it. With it came the interracial guilds, and among them: Dragon’s Wake.</p>
            <p>The guild called Dragon’s Wake somehow managed to convince the the senate of The All-Hood to give the guild exclusive rights to The Isle of Life. The guild then handpicked their very best, Sonja “Long-Blade” Cirrus, to lead the expedition. Cirrus was given the task of establishing a harbour city, exploring the island, building new strongholds as she goes, and to find out, once and for all, if the legends have any base in reality. This is where you come in.</p>
            <p>You've joined Dragon’s Wake for reasons of your own, but you are now employed by the guild, and as such, must follow guild rules. The city of Anchor is still  in its infancy, but inside of its walls is now considered a safe-haven for any members of the guild. As is custom, assignments are handed out on a first-come, first-serve-basis. You are free to follow up on rumours you hear about the area, or take on tasks from other people inside the city.</p>
